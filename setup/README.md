# Introduction

Setting up Chevereto requires a server environment where the software and uploaded files will be served.

If you are just getting started with self-hosted applications, we recommend you to follow the [root install](./root-install.md) guide. The root install guide covers everything the server needs to run the software.

> We highly recommend a VPS to get the most out of Chevereto.

## Requirements

Your server must meet the system [requirements](./requirements.md).

> It is very likely to encounter server issues if your server doesn't strictly meet the system requirements.

## Install

There are many different [install](./install.md) methods that you can follow depending of what kind of server you choose. The guide contains all the known installation procedures.

> Considering [contributing](../contributed.md) your own installation guide to help other users.

# Installer

The Installer is a single PHP file that downloads, extracts and install Chevereto. You can [download](https://chevereto.com/download/file/installer) it and execute it anywhere you want to install Chevereto.

You can learn more about it at [chevereto/installer](https://github.com/chevereto/installer) which is build from [chevereto/installer-source](https://github.com/chevereto/installer-source)

## How it Works

- Upload the [installer](https://chevereto.com/download/file/installer) to your target destination (usually the `public_html` folder).
- Open your website at `/installer.php` and follow the process.

The installer will prompt with steps to install the software, after that it will download the software, extract it and it will post to `/install` the data previously provided.

## Troubleshoot

::: warning DON'T PANIC
The installer works on top of HTTP so it relies in many sub-systems that could fail. If doesn't work for you the recommendation is to follow another [install](install.md) procedure.
:::

- It fails **before** extracting the software: Switch to manual installation
- It fails **after** extracting the software: Go to `/install` to continue the process

> âš  In both cases REMOVE the `installer.php` file

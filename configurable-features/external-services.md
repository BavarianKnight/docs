# External services

Chevereto includes built-in support for CDN, reCAPTCHA, comment systems, analytics and Cloudflare. The external services can be configured at Dashboard > Settings > External services.

## CDN

Detailed information about the integration with this service can be found at the [CDN documentation](./../extend/CDN.md).

## reCAPTCHA

reCAPTCHA helps to prevent bots from signing up and try to brute-force an user password. To enable this feature you will need to get a [reCAPTCHA key](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/).

## Comment systems

This allows you to paste the comment code from serveral comment systems providers like [Disqus](https://disqus.com), LiveFyre or Facebook. This code will be inserted in the image viewer comments section.

## Analytics codes

This allows you to paste the code provided from your analytics service provider like Google Analytics. This code will be printed in each page.

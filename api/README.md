# API introduction

Chevereto application programming interface (API) allows developers to use Chevereto within their applications using an standardized method. In other words it allows you to use some Chevereto functionalities programmatically.

Current Chevereto API is [Chevereto API v1](./V1.md) which allows image upload from file, base64 or image URL. In the future we will add an API v2 with more methods, per user, rate limiting and more features.

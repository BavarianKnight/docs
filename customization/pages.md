Create and Manage Pages
-----------------------

To add or manage pages simply go to `Dashboard > Settings > Pages` where you will be able to add, edit and delete pages. You can customize page title, link rel, metatags, icon, etc.

Page types
----------

You can create full featured PHP pages that can take advantage of all the G\ framework and Chevereto napespace so you can achieve pages that looks just like the rest of the system or even pages that looks complety different. You can also create linked pages that you can customize to link your Facebook fan page or anything you want. You can also create invisible pages that will be only visible if someone knows the URL key.

Custom Styles and Coding
------------------------

Chevereto pages are a wrapper of The [G\ Library](https://g.chevereto.com/) loader which means that this pages can be complete customized in absolute all the code. You can use your own header, footer, metatags, etc.

This means that you can use any code you want including HTML, JS, CSS and PHP. You can even create pages that look completely different from the main site look and you can even use all the system classes and functions (Both G\ and Chevereto) to make it easier and yet more powerful.
